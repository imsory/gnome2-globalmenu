# Mini Projects #

Mini projects available to all, coders or non coders

In the spirit of GHOP which enabled this project to get a second life, here are a few mini-project that you can do without having to be a coder or a GTK+ wizard. We hope it might attract even more people around GnomeMenu and the concept of a document centric desktop, and help foster the project.
Note that unlike GHOP, the only prize you'll get is a special mention and the gratitude of many others (and a perhaps a free beer/soda if you happen to come in Paris one day ;-)

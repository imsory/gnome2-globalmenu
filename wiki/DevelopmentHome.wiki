We are at 0.6.

= Roadmap =
  * 0.1: `Origin`
    * Original gtk2-aqd and gnome-macmenu-applet
  * 0.2: `Rename`
    * Rename to Global Menu in order to avoid confusion.
    * Menu bars are scrollable if they are too long to fit into the screen
  * 0.3: `Clean-up`
    * Introduce the inter-process communication protocol for GlobalMenuBar
    * Initial the support for Skinning.
    * GConf preference support for the applet.
    * Better UI.
  * 0.4: `Re-designation` - March 1st, 2008 Can we meet this date? YES WE CAN.
    * Completely redesign in OO to fit every piece into current GDK/GTK architecture.
    * Introduce GnomenuMenuBar and the concept: `global menu for legacy gtk software`
    * Fully solve the Skinning Problem
    * MenuServer widget for general purpose menu server.
  * 0.45: `Get some KDE` - thrown away.
    * GnomenuServerInterface
    * GnomenuServerHelper, implements GnomenuServerInterface 
    * KdeMenuServerHelper, implements GnomenuServerInterface; 
      Due to limitation, it shall lacks function.
    * Widget GnomenuMenuServer
  * 0.5: `trinity` - slipped; doomed; abandoned
    * The Menu system introspects itself store the introspection data as a property when attached to a toplevel window.
    * Minimize the IPC formalism. Abandon GnomenuSocket. SMS (broadcasting short messages).
    * The Menu Applet use the introspection data on the SMS listener window to build the menubar on the fly. (How to deal with the `transient_for` property?)
    * Menu Applet try to grab the `Alt+` shortcuts. (the AccelKeys should be controled by `GtkAction` and we don't need to bother on it.)
    * Slowest part is sending messages.
    * <F10> to take menubar back to the window. (up to changing)
  * 0.6: `dbus`
    * Move to [http://vala.gnome.org vala] for core development.
    * Every Application exposes the Menu System as a DBus connection. 
    * Every application registers the DBus bus name in `org.gnome.GlobalMenu.Server`
  * 1.0: `Happy New Year` - or `Merry Christmas`?
    * Stable Release!
    * either the 0.5 arch or the 0.4 arch
    * work on 64bit and PPC.

in trunk, check out ClassMap.dia for a brief view of classes.

GnomenuMenuBar.switch() accepts a string form xwindow id, and shows the first menu bar of the given window.

== Classes ==

|| Class Name || Desc ||Parent       || Dependencies || Location ||
|| GtkMenuBar || old gtk menubar, hacked to return GnomenuMenuBar on demand|| GtkMenuShell || GtkMenuItem, GnomenuMenuBar || gtk||
|| GnomenuMenuBar || global menubar || GtkMenuBar || || libgnomenu ||
|| GnomenuGlobalMenu || Global menu holder || GtkWidget ||  ||libgnomenu ||
== Arch ==

GnomenuMenuBar has two mode, decided by 'is-global-menu' property. 

GnomeMenuQuirks will load quirks from a rc file(~/.libgnomenu.conf and /etc/libgnomenu.conf

Format:
{{{
program_name(regexp)      :       ignore, force-show-all, hide-on-quit, roaming
program_name/detail       :       ...................................
}}}
If there is multi matches, the result is accumulative.

Development documentation can be build. {{{
./autogen.sh --enable-gtk-doc
make
nautilus doc/
}}}

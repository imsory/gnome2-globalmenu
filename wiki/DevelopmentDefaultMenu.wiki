I also have to say , that i haven't tested it much, so there are most probably going to be bugs, so be WARNED . The main reason i post this is that i am going to be very busy for the next month (exams) so i won't have time to work on this till October. So if anyone is interested to play with the code, here it is .

In order for this to work, extract the macmenu_scripts archive inside your home folder (so that you have a new .macmenu folder in there ).

Most of the entries that do work, do that through scripts for now (zenity).

What works:

-The whole file menu except from Connect to Server.
-The preferences entry in the Edit menu.
-The only view menu entry (special characters).
-The whole go menu except the clear history option.
-The help menu (yes i know, a tough one :P ).

Future plans:

-Fix the rest of the entries.
-Add a nautilus history menu entry to the Go menu.
-Add a window list to the Windows menu.
-Add entries for maximizing and minimizing windows to the Windows menu.
-Change the menu icons to better looking (non stock) versions.

I haven't decided yet what to do with the view menu, suggestions for entries are welcome and encouraged.

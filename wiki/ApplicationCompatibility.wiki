#summary A list of compatible applications

= Compatibility List =
Here is a list of applications' compatibility with gnome-globalmenu. These applications works with `libgnomenu` via gtk-aqd patch.

== Perfect ==
 * Accessories 
   * gnome-terminal
   * gcalc
   * gedit
   * File-Roller
   * ghex2
 * Office/Productive
   * DIA
   * Gimp
   * gthumb
   * chmsee
   * evince
   * inkscape
   * gnome-specimen
   * ardour2 (foreround color is gray)
 * Internet
   * Galeon
   * Epiphany (Web Browser)
   * Evolution
   * Pidgin
   * ekiga
   * FileZilla
   * xchat
   * Azureus
 * Development
   * devhelp
   * Glade
   * gvim
   * eclipse
   * nemiver
 * Multimedia/Entertainment
   * TuxGuitar
   * gnome-sound-recorder
   * Rhythmbox
   * GNU Solfege
== Small problems ==
 * Desktop Menu Bar: Nautilus don't display desktop menu bar by default. One needs to edit `~/.libgnomenu.conf` to work around. (default quirk shipped in /etc/libgnomenu.conf; but don't work for every Locale)
   * nautilus 
   * thunar (perhaps)
 * Improper quit: The following applications don't dispose the menu bar; they hold a reference to the widgets and don't release it. It is their bug and we can't do anything. The menu server needs several seconds to realize the application has quited.
   * F-spot
   * mousepad
 * Don't know what problem it is.
   * Totem
 * Blank at original menu bar position: One needs a quirk entry(roaming) to avoid the blank of the menu bar. The quirk, as the name indicates, makes the menu bar always out from the application window.
   * wxWindow application ( quirk shipped by default, assuming they all begin with `wx*`)
   * RapidSVN
   * audacity
   * VLC (a wxapp that doesn't work with the quirk)
== Big problems ==
 TBD

== Crash ==
 TBD

== Not support ==
 * Pseudo GTK applications, which don't use GTK widgets:
   * Firefox
   * Openoffice
 * Any application runs under another user account. e.g. all the system management applications. This is also a security consideration.

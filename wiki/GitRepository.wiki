# Obtaining the Source Code
=== Hosted on GitHub ===

The source code of Global Menu is hosted on github.

To obtain a copy, use the following command:
{{{
git clone git://github.com/gnome-globalmenu/gnome-globalmenu.git
}}}

Please send mails to gnome-globalmenu@googlegroups.com or contact rainwoodman to obtain the write access to the repository. A github account(free of charge) is required.

Notice that we still track bugs on Google Code.

=== What about the Google Code SVN Repository ===

Global Menu was hosted on Google Code SVN Repository before rev 2719.

After the migration, the source code on googlecode(aka: gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode.com/svn/) is fronzen at rev2719, Sat Oct 10 18:54 EST). Modifications after this point will divert from the git repository, therefore people with svn write access are urged not to commit any changes.

Wiki and Gentoo overlay remains on the subversion services.

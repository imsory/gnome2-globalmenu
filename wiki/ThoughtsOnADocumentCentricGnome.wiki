#summary Discussion and thoughts On A Document-Centric Gnome

= Areas to Work On =

- Gnome-Global-Menu (This project is doing it)

- Carousel (from the CoverFlow principle) http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415816 (MacSlow is working on it for Rhythmbox, will be easy to integrate into Gnome)
Gloobus has a working version with non standard libs, but the new version hasn't reimplemented it yet with standard libs

- Sidebar should categorize items displayed with headings http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508404
A mockup has been created and Discussion is on going

-Thumbnails and GNOME: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347694 Needs love.

-Previews : a lot of work to go there: http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#preview and http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#quicklook

This is the idea page for an GNOME GSoC Project Project.

# Global Menu integration of GnomeShell #

Background: Currently, Global Menu is integrated into Gnome via Gnome Panel. This adds an optional more document-centric interface to the GNOME Desktop.
Benefits: By integrating Global Menu into Gnome Shell via a plugin or module, the future GNOME Desktop will also be compatible of a more document-centric desktop. If Global Menu is not integrated into GnomeShell, it would be a regression in GlobalMenu from what we reached with Gnome 2.x.

Requirements:
The project is based on Gtk+, Vala, GJS(javascript), GObject-Introspection.
The programmer also needs to learn libgnomenu(the globalmenu supporting library) and gnome-shell during the summer.

# How to Install Global Menu to your GNOME Desktop #

Global Menu works out of box.

  1. Install a pre-built binary package
    * Ubuntu: Install from our [PPA repository](InstallingonUbuntu.md)
    * Fedora: Search for globalmenu in Add/Remove Applications.
    * Not so lucky? You can always [make install](BuildFromSource.md)
  1. Add `Global Menu Panel Applet` (or an equivalent name in you language) to the top panel
  1. Right click on applet and choose `Enable Global Menu` (or an equivalent name in your language)

That's all. It's just that easy!

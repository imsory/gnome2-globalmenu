### What about the Google Code SVN Repository ###

Global Menu was hosted on Google Code SVN Repository before rev 2719.

After the migration, the source code on googlecode(aka: gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode.com/svn/) is fronzen at rev2719, Sat Oct 10 18:54 EST). Modifications after this point will divert from the git repository, therefore people with svn write access are urged not to commit any changes.

Wiki and Gentoo overlay remains on the subversion services.
